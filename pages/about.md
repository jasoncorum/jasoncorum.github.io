    <p>I am a film Production Designer and Art Director with a wide range of interests and talents. I am highly creative with a sharp eye for details. I have excellent communication skills and the ability to work with a wide range of people, budgets, styles and mediums. </p>
    <p>As far as the more traditional bio stuff goes, I am originally from Richmond, Virginia where I was born and raised. I have two Bachelors degrees from the University of Maryland at College Park. My first Bachelors degree is in Romance Languages with specialties in French and Spanish. My second Bachelors degree is in Theatre with specialties in both acting and scene design.</p>
    <p>I have also studied Japanese, Portuguese, Arabic, Farsi, Quechua and German. I have traveled the world to every continent except Australia and Antartica. </p>
    <p>I worked professionally for four years in Chicago in theatre, promotional events and motivational speaking. I am a graduate of Illinois State University, where I received my Masters of Fine Arts in Scene Design. I came to Los Angeles to work in Production Design in the film industry. </p>
    <p>I really enjoy everything I do and I like to do a little bit of everything!</p>
